#### How to use GitHub
1. **GitHub Hosting:**
   - Stores code, provides version control, allows for collaboration, and looks good on resumes.
   - Offers extra features like website hosting, issue tracking, project management, and continuous deployment.

2. **Cloning a Repository:**
   - Use `git clone [URL]` to get a copy of the repository onto your local machine.
   - Remember to be in the right directory before cloning.

3. **Making Changes:**
   - After making changes locally, use `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` to update the repository on GitHub.

4. **Basic Git Commands:**
   - `git pull`: Get the latest changes from GitHub.
   - `git commit -am "message"`: Commit changes with a message.
   - `git push`: Push changes to GitHub.
   
5. **Handling Merge Conflicts:**
   - Conflicts occur when two people modify the same line of code.
   - Resolve by editing the file manually in VS Code, keeping the desired changes from both commits.

6. **README.md and notes.md:**
   - README.md: Describes your project, displayed on the GitHub repository page.
   - notes.md: Personal notes for learning and documentation, useful for reference.

### HTML Document Structure
- **Tags**: Define elements with `<tagname>` and `</tagname>`.
  - Example: `<p>Hello world</p>`.
- **Basic Structure**:
  ```html
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html>
    <head>
      <title>Title Here</title>
    </head>
    <body>
      <main>
        <p>Hello world</p>
      </main>
    </body>
  </html>
  ```

### Common HTML Elements

  - `<html>`: Top-level container.
  - `<head>`: Metadata (e.g., `<title>`).
