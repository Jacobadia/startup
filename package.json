  "description": "The TTRPG Inventory Manager is a web-based tool inspired by the Resident Evil 4 inventory system, designed for tabletop role-playing games (TTRPGs). It allows players to manage and organize their in-game items visually, helping them fit everything into limited inventory spaces and helping them not to forget all the crap they carry around. With simple drag-and-drop interactivity, users can arrange items, weapons, and equipment in a grid-based inventory, making it perfect for a variety of TTRPG campaigns.",
